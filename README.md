## Matrix Search Algorithm

## Hypothesis
Our original hypothesis for this lab was that the MatrixFinder algorithm will run in linear time.

To perform this lab, we made a forloop that will iterate as the value of n increments by 100 up to a certain value (~100 iterations). At the top of the loop, we saved the currentTimeMillis() in a variable, and after performing the algorithm, we saved currentTimeMillis() in another variable and saved the difference of those two variables in another variable (which we printed out).
